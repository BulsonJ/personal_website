Hi there! My name is **Jack Bulson**, I am currently a Gameplay Programmer at Sumo Digital. I have just under **3 years professional experience** working as a **Gameplay Programmer**, primarily in Unreal Engine. 

I have a passion for working on creating fun and enjoyable gameplay experiences. In addition to gameplay programming, I also enjoy learning about the rendering pipeline & processes, as well as programming materials & shaders. I enjoy working across multiple disciplines to solve various problems that crop up during development.

I previously worked on [Critter Cafe]({% post_url 2025-02-02-critter-cafe %}) and [DeathSprint 66]({% post_url 2025-02-01-deathsprint %}). I graduated from my MComp in Games Engineering course from Newcastle University in 2024 with a 1st class result.

I also enjoy talking about my experience in the industry. In 2024, I went back to Newcastle University as a representative of Sumo Newcastle. I discussed what it's like entering the games industry and the expectations of you as a Graduate on a day-to-day basis.
