Gladiator is a game I created in my 3rd year of university for my "Game Development" module. We were tasked with creating a prototype and then a full version of a game entirely created ourselves.

In Gladiator, you assume the character of a gladiator, in the arenas having to fight to survive. The aim of the game is to eliminate all enemies and progress to the next round. 

This is a fairly simple concept and if given more time to develop, I would have loved to create a more interesting scoring system and an easier way for people to share their hi-scores, such as a leadboard.

You can play the game [here](https://bulsonj.github.io/csc3224_GameDev/) and the source code repository is [here](https://github.com/BulsonJ/csc3224_GameDev).
