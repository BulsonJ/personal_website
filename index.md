Hi there! My name is **Jack Bulson**, I am currently a Gameplay Programmer at Red Rover Interactive. I have **3 years professional experience** working as a **Gameplay Programmer**, primarily in Unreal Engine with C++. 

I have a passion for graphics programming, learning about the rendering pipeline as well as programming materials & shaders. In addition, I enjoy creating fun gameplay mechanics, and working with designers and other disciplines to create the best experience we can for players.

I'm currently working on [Enginefall]({% post_url 2025-04-15-enginefall %}). I previously worked on [Critter Cafe]({% post_url 2025-02-02-critter-cafe %}) and [DeathSprint 66]({% post_url 2025-02-01-deathsprint %}). I graduated from my MComp in Games Engineering course from Newcastle University in 2024.

I also enjoy talking about my experience in the industry. In 2024, I went back to Newcastle University as a representative of Sumo Newcastle. I discussed what it's like entering the games industry and the expectations of you as a Graduate on a day-to-day basis.
