The third module I completed at University was Advanced Game Technologies. This module focused on creating a physics engines, and our submission was to create a game based on Screwball Scramble.

If I'm honest, this was the work that I found the hardest this year. Although I enjoyed the gameplay side of it, I found it tough creating a physics system and making objects behave as you would expect. However, it was interesting to learn about how 3D physics engines work at a basic level and I feel that I did learn a lot through it.
