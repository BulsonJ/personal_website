I worked as a **Gameplay Programmer** on **Critter Cafe** from September 2023 to December 2024.

My responsibilities included:
- Implementing the three tools the character can use, the Hammer, the Frisbee and the WingClips. This involved working with design & animation to make them work, make them feel good and make them look good.
- Implementing various level ingredients to be used within the Rescue Levels. This involved consistent communication with level design & art to ensure that pieces worked functionally and aesthetically.
- Implementing the initial version of the Open For Trade activity as well as the Pouring Coffee minigame.
- Learning more about Unreal's collision system to improve our projects setup and usage of collision presets & responses to ensure correct behaviour
- Fixing Steam Deck specific bugs towards the end of the project to ensure we would be verified on Steam Deck

        <p>The Hammer was the first tool we made. You could do a basic swing, hold it for a circular swing, or if you had the powerup, hold it for an overhead smash attack.</p>

        <p class="figure-title">Frisbee</p>
        <p>The Frisbee was the second tool to be developed. We had an aiming/chargeup phase with an aiming indicator, and once released the Frisbee could be thrown.</p>

        <p class="figure-title">Wing Clips</p>
        <p>The Wing Clips enabled you to use the JumpPads to Jump. They could be charged to Jump further if you had the PowerUp. We had two variations of the JumpPads, horizontal and vertical.</p>

        <p class="figure-title">Level Ingredients</p>
        <p>We had a variety of level ingredients. I primarily implemented the blocks, gates and switches, and the initial implementation of the amber we used to encase these ingredients.</p>

        <p class="figure-title">Pouring Coffee MiniGame</p>
        <p>This was the first minigame we made in order to create a first playable version of the Open For Trade activity. I revisited this minigame later on in the project where we added multiple steps to the pouring as the difficulty increased.</p>
