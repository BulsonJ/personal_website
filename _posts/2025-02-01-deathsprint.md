I worked as a **Gameplay Programmer** on **DeathSprint 66** from December 2022 to September 2023.

I was part of the Bachman Racing Prototype Team, which meant I was on the project before it went into full production.

Over the course of this project, I:
- Implemented the ideas for a feature team, prototyping gameplay elements that did not make it into the final release
- Worked with Level Design to create different level ingredients that they needed
- Implemented some fairly straightforward UI, such as an in-game leaderboard
- Fixed general gameplay bugs that appeared
- Gained experience with networking & replication
