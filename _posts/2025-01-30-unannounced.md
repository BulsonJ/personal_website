I worked as a **Gameplay Programmer** on an **Unannounced Project** from May 2022 to December 2022.

This was my first project in the industry. I was part of a small team exploring a concept for a possible future project.

Responsibilities:
- Learn **Unreal Engine** and other development tools & workflow I had not used before (Perforce, TeamCity etc)
- Implemented some basic UI and gameplay mechanics (in C++ and in blueprint)
- Implemented an **outline system** for highlighting interactable objects
