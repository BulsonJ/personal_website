I worked as a **Gameplay Programmer** on **Critter Cafe** from September 2023 to December 2024.

My responsibilities included:
- Implementing the three tools the character can use, the Hammer, the Frisbee and the WingClips. This involved working with design & animation to make them work, make them feel good and make them look good.
- Implementing various level ingredients to be used within the Rescue Levels. This involved consistent communication with level design & art to ensure that pieces worked functionally and aesthetically.
- Implementing the initial version of the Open For Trade activity as well as the Pouring Coffee minigame.
- Learning more about Unreal's collision system to improve our projects setup and usage of collision presets & responses to ensure correct behaviour
- Fixing Steam Deck specific bugs towards the end of the project to ensure we would be verified on Steam Deck

        <p>The Frisbee was the second tool to be developed. We had an aiming/chargeup phase with an aiming indicator, and once released the Frisbee could be thrown.</p>

        <p>The Wing Clips enabled you to use the JumpPads to Jump. They could be charged to Jump further if you had the PowerUp. We had two variations of the JumpPads, horizontal and vertical.</p>
